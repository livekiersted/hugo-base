                    <p>Coaching &amp; Strategy for White People, POC in White Spaces, and Organizations</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re navigating the impact of white supremacy‚Äîwhether in your personal relationships, your workplace, or your leadership role‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to do it alone.</p>
<p>I work with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White people</strong>‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre newly waking up or years in, I help you move past guilt, confusion, and overwhelm into clarity, action, and deepened integrity.</li>
<li><strong>POC navigating white spaces</strong>‚Äîdecode the baffling, frustrating behaviors of white colleagues, bosses, and friends. Validate your experience, strategize next steps, and move through it with more ease.</li>
<li><strong>Organizations &amp; leadership</strong>‚Äîfrom racially diverse teams struggling to function well together to DEI-minded leaders losing institutional support, I bring a clear lens to power dynamics, team culture, and what needs to shift.</li>
</ul>
<p>This work can feel isolating, confusing, and discouraging. But clarity is possible. You can move from stuck to strategic, from alone to deeply connected, from overwhelmed to knowing exactly what needs to happen next. Let‚Äôs figure it out together.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm a <strong>white woman who has been doing this work deeply for many years</strong>. I don‚Äôt claim to understand the experience of being a person of color, but I <strong>do</strong> understand how whiteness operates‚Äîbecause I live it. I‚Äôve done all the things white women do, and I‚Äôve worked hard to see them clearly and move differently. The POC in my life have given me the <strong>gift of honest feedback</strong> about my whiteness, and that clarity has helped me recognize patterns as they arise, both in myself and in my clients.</p>
<p>This work isn‚Äôt just something I do‚Äîit‚Äôs <strong>deeply personal</strong> to me. I love working with people for whom it‚Äôs personal too, whether it‚Äôs showing up in their relationships, workplace, leadership, or community. <strong>I believe we each have a role to play in the lifelong struggle against racism</strong>, and I help people find <strong>their lane</strong>‚Äîso they can move through it with clarity, integrity, and impact.</p>
<p>My clients come to me when they need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deep validation</strong>‚Äîto hear <em>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not crazy‚Äù</em> from someone who <em>gets it</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Sharp clarity</strong>‚Äîto make sense of what‚Äôs happening beneath the surface, so they can move forward instead of spinning.</li>
<li><strong>Practical strategies</strong>‚Äîthat work in real-life relationships, workplaces, and leadership roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>I bring <strong>deep compassion, clear-eyed honesty, and an unshakable belief in your capacity to navigate this</strong>. I‚Äôll care about you while also telling you the truth. I see power dynamics, I see patterns, and I make the invisible visible.</p>
<p><strong>If you‚Äôre ready to move forward, we can figure this out together.</strong></p>

  <p>‚ÄúLive/DEI coaching has quickly become irreplaceable in my life as a resource for working (and living!) in healthier and more balanced ways.‚Äù</p>
</div>
<div class="testimonial">
  <p>‚ÄúWorking with Live has been nothing short of transformative. She helped me take full ownership of the things I can control‚Äîhow I respond to challenges, how I navigate adversity and to embrace my experiences with strength and clarity. For the first time in my career, someone has articulated my daily experience as a professional Black woman in a way that made me feel truly seen and validated.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôve often felt dismissed or made to doubt my own thoughts and feelings, as though my experiences were being minimized or even erased. Live was the first person to tell me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not crazy,‚Äù with a depth of understanding that was profoundly healing. That acknowledgment was career-changing.</p>
  <p>I‚Äôve been working for nearly 30 years, and transitioning into this new industry over a decade ago has been incredibly difficult to navigate. I can say with absolute certainty that Live‚Äôs support has been a gift. Her ability to create space for reflection, self-awareness, and growth has had a profound impact on me. I am deeply grateful for her wisdom, compassion, and the important work she is doing in this world.‚Äù</p>
