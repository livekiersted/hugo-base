Hello friend! This repository holds the code and content for this website. It is a static website built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io).

## Updating Content

If you're just looking to update some content, this should be relatively
straightforward. The sections of the main page live in the
[content/homepage](./content/homepage/) directory, the files are named similarly
to the section names. See the readme in this directory for more information.

After you've updated the files with new content, commit your changes and they
should be automatically deployed in under a minute.

## Local Development

If you're doing something more involved than updating content (changing
layouts/themes) or you want to be able to preview changes before they go live,
you can run the website on your own local computer.

1. Clone this repository
2. Install hugo - [instructions](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
3. Run `hugo serve` from the root of this repository
4. See your changes previewed live in the browser
